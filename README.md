## Homework Assignment 1 - Horiseon 

For this assignment, I was given a predesigned HTML and CSS file of a working site. With these given templates, I was able to refactor both in ways that improved the accessibility of the site. Although there are many things that could have been done to improve a single site; I enhanced only a few key points that matched the given criteria for this assignment. Some changes that were made includes the following: changing tags to semantic elements, improving the structure of the HTML elements, adding alt attributes to imgs, ensuring that heading attributes fall in sequential order, etc.
